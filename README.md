# MOVIES RESTful API 

<h4>MAIN OBJECTIVES</h4>

The Movies API is a user-friendly and intuitive RESTful API designed to simplify the process of creating (POST), deleting (DELETE), modifying (PATCH), and searching (GET) movies using RESTful concepts and industry best practices. In addition, the API offers a range of FILTER OPTIONS, allowing users to sort and select movies based on criteria such as Price, Duration, and Id, with the option to organize results in ascending or descending order.
